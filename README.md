  * Web Pages
  * Database
  * Server to bridge between client and database

TODO:

Any drawbacks to certain approaches


Which processes are we using? {

# Running the server.js file

```
-- start your [VM](https://www.port.ac.uk/myvm)

-- launch a connection and create the directory you want for the github repository using mkdir and navigate to it with cd 'the name'

-- clone the INSE studylog repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/UP829438/INSE-studylog.git
```

-- type npm install to install all required packages for the server to run

-- type npm start to start the server

-- you can now enter the ip for your VM and the server should come up.

```
# Get the database working

Just run the SQL in createDatabase.sql in your VM mysql.
